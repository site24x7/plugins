# MYSQL MONITORING


## Quick installation

If you're using Linux servers, use the MySQL plugin installer that checks the prerequisites and installs the plugin with a bash script. You don't need to manually set up the plugin if you're using the installer.

Execute the command below in the terminal to run the installer and follow the instructions displayed on-screen:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/mysql_monitoring/installer/Site24x7MySQLPluginInstaller.sh && sudo bash Site24x7MySQLPluginInstaller.sh
```
## Standard Installation
If you're not using Linux servers or want to install the plugin manually, follow the steps below.


### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent/Site24x7 Windows agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.
- Install python with version>=3.7
- Install pymysql using the following command,
  
	```bash
	pip3 install pymysql
 	```
 
- To create a MySQL user:

	```sql
	CREATE USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
	```
  Select on queries permission is required to execute the queries mentioned above.
  
	```sql
	GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO username@hostname IDENTIFIED BY password;
	```
  For Example, create a user called 'site24x7' with 'site24x7' as password. Give Select permission, SUPER or REPLICATION CLIENT privilege(s)  for the 'site24x7' user and  flush the privileges:

  	```sql
	CREATE USER site24x7@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'site24x7';
	GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO site24x7@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'site24x7';
	use mysql;
  	UPDATE mysql.user SET Super_Priv='Y' WHERE user='site24x7' AND host='localhost'; 
  	UPDATE mysql.user SET Repl_client_priv='Y' WHERE user='site24x7' AND host='localhost';
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	```
   
  For MariaDB, use the following command:
  
  	```sql
	CREATE USER site24x7@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'site24x7';
	GRANT SUPER ON *.* TO 'site24x7'@'localhost';
	GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'site24x7'@'localhost'; 
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	```

---
### Plugin Installation 

- Create a directory `mysql_monitoring`.
		
- Download  the below files and place it under the `mysql_monitoring` directory.

	```bash
	wget https://github.com/site24x7/plugins/raw/master/mysql_monitoring/pymysql/pymysql.zip && unzip pymysql.zip && rm pymysql.zip
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/mysql_monitoring/mysql_monitoring.py && sed -i "1s|^.*|#! $(which python3)|" mysql_monitoring.py
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/mysql_monitoring/mysql_monitoring.cfg
  	```

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  
	```bash
	python mysql_monitoring.py --host "localhost" --port "3306" --username "username" --password "password" 
	```
- After above command with parameters gives expected output, please configure the relevant parameters in the mysql_monitoring.cfg file.
	```bash
	[MySQL]
	host = "localhost"
	port = "3306"
	username = "root"
	password = ""
	logs_enabled=true
	log_type_name="Mysql General Logs"
	log_file_path="/var/log/mysql/error.log"
 	```

- Applog is supported for MySQL Monitoring. To enable applog for this plugin, configure logs_enabled=true and configure log_type_name and log_file_path as need.

#### Linux
- Place the `mysql_monitoring` folder under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory : 
	```bash
	mv mysql_monitoring /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins
 	```
#### Windows
- Since it's a Python plugin, to run the plugin in a Windows server please follow the steps in [this link](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers). The remaining configuration steps are the same.

- Move the folder `mysql_monitoring` under Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory: 

		C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins
---

### Failover monitoring supported
- Receive failover alerts each time there is a failover between master and slave. This will help you ensure that your MySQL environment is always monitored and you receive timely alerts.
