ActiveMQ Queue Monitoring 
==============================================

Apache ActiveMQ enables easy processing of messages from various applications and communicates them across your infrastructure. Install and configure the ActiveMQ plugin to get a detailed view of how your systems and services are performing, all in a single, intuitive dashboard.

Follow the below steps to configure the ActiveMQ plugin and the monitoring metrics for providing in-depth visibility into the performance, availability, and usage stats of Apache ActiveMQ instances.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

- Python version must be 3.7 or above.

- Plugin Uses "JPype" python library. This module is used to execute the jmx query and get data. Execute the below command to install python JPype module in your server.

		pip install JPype1
		
- JMX connection should be enabled in the Apache ActiveMQ installation folder. 
  - To enable it with password protection follow the [ActiveMQ Documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/jmx)
  - To enable it without passsword protection follow the below steps: 
  	- Open conf/activemq.xml inside the installation folder of Apache ActiveMQ and change the following attributes

	```
		<managementContext>
    		     <managementContext createConnector="true" connectorPort="1099"/>
		</managementContext>
	```
	
	
	
	
- Restart the activemq service after making the above changes.

### Plugin installation
---

- Create a folder "activemq"

		mkdir activemq
  		cd activemq/

- Download all the files in "activemq" folder and place it under the "activemq" directory

	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/activemq/activemq.py
	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/activemq/activemq.cfg
	

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  

		python activemq.py –-host_name="localhost" -–port="1099" -–broker_name="your_broker_name" --destination_name="your_queue_name"

#### Configurations
-  Edit the activemq.cfg file with appropriate arguments
	```
	[display_name]
	host_name=“your_ip_address”
	port=“1099”
	broker_name=“your_broker_name”
	destination_name=“your_destination_name”
	```
#### Linux

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the activemq.py script.

- Place the "activemq" under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory:

        mv activemq /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/

#### Windows

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the activemq.py script.

-  Further move the folder "activemq" into the  Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory:

        C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\



The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
