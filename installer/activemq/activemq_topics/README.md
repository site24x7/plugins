ActiveMQ Topics Monitoring 
==============================================

Apache ActiveMQ enables easy processing of messages from various applications and communicates them across your infrastructure. Install and configure the ActiveMQ plugin to get a detailed view of how your systems and services are performing, all in a single, intuitive dashboard.

Follow the below steps to configure the ActiveMQ plugin and the monitoring metrics for providing in-depth visibility into the performance, availability, and usage stats of Apache ActiveMQ instances.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

- Python version must be 3.7 or above.

- Plugin Uses "JPype" python library. This module is used to execute the jmx query and get data. Execute the below command to install python JPype modeule in your server. 

		pip install JPype1
		
- JMX connection should be enabled in the Apache ActiveMQ installation folder. 
  - To enable it with password protection follow the [ActiveMQ Documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/jmx)
  - To enable it without passsword protection follow the below steps: 
  	- Open conf/activemq.xml inside the installation folder of Apache ActiveMQ and change the following attributes

	```
		<managementContext>
    		     <managementContext createConnector="true" connectorPort="1099"/>
		</managementContext>
	```
	
Restart the instance after making the above changes.

### Plugin installation
---

- Create a folder "activemq_topics"

		mkdir activemq_topics
  		cd activemq_topics/
  
- Download all the files in "activemq_topics" folder and place it under the "activemq_topics" directory

	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/activemq/activemq_topics/activemq_topics.py
	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/activemq/activemq_topics/activemq_topics.cfg
	
- Configure the keys to be monitored, as mentioned in the configuration section below.

  #### Configurations
    
		[active mq topic]
		hostname="localhost"
		port="1099"
		broker_name="broker_name"
		topic_name="topic_name"
		logs_enabled="False"
		log_type_name=None
		log_file_path=None
    

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  

  ```
  python activemq_topics.py --hostname "ip-address" --port "port" --broker_name "broker_name" --topic_name "topic_name"
  ```


##### Linux 

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the activemq_topics.py script.

- Create a folder "activemq_topics" under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory : 

      mv activemq_topics /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/

##### Windows 

- Since it's a Python plugin, to run the plugin in a Windows server please follow the steps in [this link](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers). The remaining configuration steps are the same.

- Create a folder "activemq" under Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory : 

      C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\activemq_topics

The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.

### Metrics Captured

- **AlwaysRetroactive** 
  
    This metric specifies whether messages are always retroactive, meaning they can be consumed by a consumer that connects after the message was originally produced.

- **AverageBlockedTime** 

    The average time a producer was blocked waiting to send a message due to flow control.

- **AverageEnqueueTime**
  
    The average time it takes to enqueue a message in the broker.

- **AverageMessageSize** 
    
    The average size of messages stored in the broker.

- **BlockedProducerWarningInterval** 
    
    The interval at which the broker logs a warning message if producers are blocked due to flow control.

- **BlockedSends** 
    
    The number of times a producer was blocked waiting to send a message due to flow control.

- **ConsumerCount** 

    The number of consumers currently subscribed to a queue or topic.

- **DLQ** 

    The number of messages that have been moved to the dead-letter queue (DLQ) due to message expiration, exceeded maximum redelivery attempts, or other reasons.

- **DequeueCount**
 
    The total number of messages that have been dequeued from a queue or topic.

- **DispatchCount** 
    
    The total number of messages that have been dispatched to consumers.

- **DuplicateFromStoreCount** 

    The number of times a message was sent again from the store due to a failure in the original delivery.

- **EnqueueCount** 

    The total number of messages that have been enqueued in the broker.

- **ExpiredCount** 
    
    The number of messages that have expired and have been removed from the broker.

- **ForwardCount** 
    
    The number of messages that have been forwarded to another destination.

- **InFlightCount**
