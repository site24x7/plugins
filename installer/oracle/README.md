# Oracle Database Monitoring

## Quick installation

If you're using Linux servers, use the Oracle plugin installer that checks the prerequisites and installs the plugin with a bash script. You don't need to manually set up the plugin if you're using the installer.

Execute the command below in the terminal to run the installer and follow the instructions displayed on-screen:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/oracle/installer/Site24x7OraclePluginInstaller.sh && sudo bash Site24x7OraclePluginInstaller.sh
```
## Standard Installation
If you're not using Linux servers or want to install the plugin manually, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.
- Python 3.7 or higher version should be installed.
- Install **oracledb** module for python
	```
	pip3 install oracledb
	```

- Roles need to be granted

	```sql
	grant select_catalog_role to {username}
	```
	```sql
	grant create session to {username}
	```

### Installation  

- Create a directory named `oracle`.

	```bash
 	mkdir oracle
 	cd oracle/
 	```
 
- Install the **oracledb** python module.
	```bash
	pip3 install oracledb
	```
	
- Download the below files [oracle.cfg](https://github.com/site24x7/plugins/blob/master/oracle/oracle.cfg) and [oracle.py](https://github.com/site24x7/plugins/blob/master/oracle/oracle.py) place it under the `oracle` directory.

	```bash
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/oracle/oracle.py && sed -i "1s|^.*|#! $(which python3)|" oracle.py
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/oracle/oracle.cfg
	```
 
- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output:

	```bash
	 python3 oracle.py --hostname "localhost" --port "1521" --sid "SID" --username "USERNAME" --password "PASSWORD" --oracle_home "ORACLE_HOME"
	 ```

- After the above command with parameters gives the expected output, please configure the relevant parameters in the oracle.cfg file.

	```bash
	[ORCL]
	hostname = "localhost"
	port = "1521"
	sid = "ORCL"
	username = "oracle_username"
	password = "oracle_password"
	tls = "false"
	wallet_location = "/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/wallets"
	oracle_home = "/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/"
	```
 
#### Linux

- Place the `oracle` under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory:
  
	```bash
 	mv oracle /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins
 	```
 
#### Windows

- Since it's a Python plugin, to run the plugin in a Windows server please follow the steps in [this link](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers). The remaining configuration steps are the same.

-  Further, move the folder `oracle` into the  Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory:

        C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\oracle


The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.
