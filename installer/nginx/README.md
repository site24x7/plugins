# Nginx Plugin

## Nginx plugin installer

On Linux servers, execute the command below in the terminal to run an installer that checks the prerequisites and installs the plugin.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/nginx/installer/Site24x7NginxPluginInstaller.sh && sudo bash Site24x7NginxPluginInstaller.sh
```
	       
## Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.
- Python version 3 or higher.

#### Enable nginx_status to get metrics -

1. Open terminal and run the following command to open NGINX server configuration file.

 	```bash
	sudo vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
	```
  
2. Add the following code inside the server block which is present in the "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf" file.

 	```nginxconf
	location /nginx_status {
	    stub_status;
	}
	```
  
3. Save and close the /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file.
4. Now reload the nginx to apply the changes :

 	```bash
	sudo systemctl reload nginx
	```

5. Test the nginx status URL; it should return a response without error.

	For Example
	```
	curl http://localhost/nginx_status
	```
 	Response of the command should be similar to the below output.
	
	```
	Active connections: 2
	server accepts handled requests
	344014 344014 661581
	Reading: 0 Writing: 1 Waiting: 1
	```
 **Note :**
	The nginx status URL used was the default one. If you have assigned a domain, please use that in the URL accordingly.

## Plugin Installation  

- Once the agent is installed on the server, create a directory named `nginx`.

  	```bash
	mkdir nginx
  	cd nginx/
 	```
   
- Download all the files and place it under the `nginx` directory.
  
 	```bash
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/nginx/nginx.py && sed -i "1s|^.*|#! $(which python3)|" nginx.py
  	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/nginx/nginx.cfg
	```


- Execute the below command with the appropriate arguments to check for valid JSON output.

 	```bash
	python3 nginx.py --nginx_status_url "http://localhost/nginx_status" --username "nginx username" --password "nginx password"
 	```

- After executing the above command and receiving valid JSON, provide the command argument as configurations in the `nginx.cfg` file.

 	```bash
	[nginx]
	plugin_version=1
	heartbeat=true
	nginx_status_url="http://localhost/nginx_status"
	username="None"
	password="None"
	timeout=60
	logs_enabled = "true"
	log_type_name = "Nginx Logs"
	log_file_path = "/var/log/nginx/access*"
 	```

- Once the configuration done, move the `nginx` directory under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory: 

		mv nginx /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/

		
The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and user can see the plugin monitor under Site24x7 > Plugins > Plugin Integrations.
