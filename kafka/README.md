# **Apache Kafka Monitoring**

## About Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed stream-processing platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is written in Java and Scala, and is used to collect, process, and store real-time data streams. Its core capabilities include high throughput, scalability, and low latency, and it is often used to build stream data pipelines and applications.



## Quick installation

If you're using Linux servers, use the kafka plugin installer that checks the prerequisites and installs the plugin with a bash script. You don't need to manually set up the plugin if you're using the installer.

Execute the command below in the terminal to run the installer and follow the instructions displayed on-screen:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/kafka/installer/Site24x7KafkaPluginInstaller.sh && sudo bash Site24x7KafkaPluginInstaller.sh
```

## Standard Installation
If you're not using Linux servers or want to install the plugin manually, follow the steps below.


### Prerequisites

- To enable Kafka Broker JMX port

    Find the following code block in the kafka-server-start.sh script.


        if [ "x$KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS" = "x" ]; then
            export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx1G -Xms1G"
        fi


    Paste the following lines below the above code block.

        
        export KAFKA_JMX_OPTS="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9999"
        export JMX_PORT=9999
        
- Restart the kafka broker after the above changes.


- Install the jmxquery module for Python3.
  ```
  pip install jmxquery
  ```

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.

### Plugin Installation
- Create a directory named "kafka" 
  
- Download all the files in the "kafka" folder.
  ```
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/kafka/kafka.py && sed -i "1s|^.*|#! $(which python3)|" kafka.py
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/kafka/kafka.cfg
  ```

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output:
    
        python3 kafka.py --kafka_host "KAFKA_BROKER_HOST_IP" --kafka_jmx_port "KAFKA_BROKER_PORT_NO"
    
- After above command with parameters gives expected output, please configure the relevant parameters in the kafka.cfg file.

      [kafka]
      kafka_host = "localhost"
      kafka_jmx_port = "9999"


#### Linux

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the kafka.py script.

- Place the "kafka" under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory:

        Linux    ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/
  
#### Windows
        
- Since it's a Python plugin, to run the plugin in a Windows server please follow the steps in the below link. The remaining configuration steps are the same.
https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers
-  Further move the folder "kafka" into the  Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory:

        Windows          ->   C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\

## Supported Metrics
