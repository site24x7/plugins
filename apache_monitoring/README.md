# Plugin for Apache Monitoring

The Apache HTTP Server, commonly known as Apache, is the world's most used web server software. Configure the Site24x7 Apache plugin to monitor the performance of your Apache server and stay on top of issues at all times.

## Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.

#### Perform the following configuration in the Apache configuration file to get the performance metrics - 
1. Enable mod_status

- Apache configuration file is located at one of the following locations, depending on your Linux distribution.
	```
	    /etc/apache2/httpd.conf
	    /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
	    /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
	    /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
	```

- Open the terminal and run the following command to open the Apache configuration file "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf".

  	``` 	$ sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf 	```

- In the file "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf", search for the following line

	``` 	#LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so 	```

- Uncomment the above line by removing # at its beginning.

	``` 	LoadModule status_module modules/mod_status.so 		```



2. Configure mod_status in Apache configuration "/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf" file

- Search for the following block of code 
	```
		# Allow server status reports generated by mod_status,
		# with the URL of http://servername/server-status
		# Change the ".example.com" to match your domain to enable.
		#
		#<location server-status="">
		#    SetHandler server-status
		#    Order deny,allow
		#    Deny from all
		#    Allow from .example.com
		#</location>
	```

- Uncomment the location block by removing # in front of its lines, and update the Allow, Order and Deny directives as shown below.
	```
		<Location /server-status>
		   SetHandler server-status
		   Order allow,deny
		   Deny from all
		   Allow from all
		</Location>
	```

The above configuration works for the default Apache configuration. If you want to change the URL at which the dashboard is available, then change /server-status in the location tag as per your requirement.


Also, this configuration will not work for Virtual Hosts. If you have configurated Virtual Hosts, then you need to place this location block inside the VirtualHost block, as shown below.

	
		     <VirtualHost *:80>
			   …
			   <Location /server-status>
			      SetHandler server-status
			      Order allow,deny
			      Deny from all
			      Allow from example.com
			   </Location>
			  …
		     </VirtualHost>

3. After completing all the changes restart the Apache server using the below Linux command.
	```
	service apache restart
	```
4. After following the above steps execute the command below to verify the accessibility of the apache2 stats page.
	```
	curl -I http://localhost:80/server-status?auto
	```
	
	```
	HTTP/1.1 200 OK
	Date: Fri, 21 Apr 2023 10:11:01 GMT
	Server: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)
	Vary: Accept-Encoding
	Content-Length: 3864
	Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1

	```
	It can also be manually checked using the browser by entering the below URL.
	```
	http://localhost:80/server-status?auto
	```
*Note : The URL will differ based on what you have entered in the Apache configuration.*

## Plugin Installation  

1. Create a folder named _apache\_monitoring_.
2. Download the [apache\_monitoring.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/apache\_monitoring/apache_monitoring.py) and the [apache\_monitoring.cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/apache\_monitoring/apache_monitoring.cfg) files from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/site24x7/plugins), and place them in the _apache\_monitoring_ folder.  

	```
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/apache_monitoring/apache_monitoring.py && sed -i "1s|^.*|#! $(which python3)|" apache_monitoring.py
	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/apache_monitoring/apache_monitoring.cfg
	```
 
3. To check if the plugin is working, execute the command below with appropriate arguments and check for a valid JSON output with applicable metrics and their corresponding value.  

```
	python3 apache_monitoring.py --url=<apache stats url> --username=<apache username> --password=<apache password>
```

4. Add the applicable configurations in the _apache\_monitoring.cfg_ file.  
	You can also configure [Apache access logs](https://www.site24x7.com/help/log-management/apache-access.html) to view the top failed requests, the URLs that take the longest to retrieve data, and more.  
```
	[localhost]
	url ="http://localhost:80/server-status?auto"
	username=None
	password =None
	timeout="30"
	plugin_version ="1"
	heartbeat ="true"
	logs_enabled ="true"
	log_type_name ="Apache Access Logs"
	log_file_path ="/var/log/apache2/access.log"
```

5. Follow the steps in this [article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers) to learn how to run the Python script on a Windows server. You don't need to do this for Linux.  

6. If you have virtual hosts configured and/or need to monitor the status of multiple domains using the same plugin, refer [this link](https://www.site24x7.com/help/admin/adding-a-monitor/plugins/custom-plugins.html#multiple-config) to configure the domains.

7. Move the _apache\_monitoring_ folder to the _Site24x7 server monitoring plugins directory_.
For Linux: /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/
For Windows: C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\plugins\

The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and display performance data in Site24x7.

To view the plugin monitor and associated performance charts:

1. Log in to Site24x7.

2. Navigate to **Plugins** and click the required monitor.
