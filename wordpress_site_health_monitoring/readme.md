## Plugin Installation

1. Create a directory named `wordpress_site_health_monitoring`:

    ```bash
    mkdir wordpress_site_health_monitoring
    ```

2. Download the required files into the newly created directory:

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/wordpress_site_health_monitoring/wordpress_site_health_monitoring.cfg
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/wordpress_site_health_monitoring/wordpress_site_health_monitoring.py
    ```

3. Update the Python path in the `wordpress_site_health_monitoring.py` script by following [this guide](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers).

4. Run the following command to validate the setup and ensure the plugin outputs valid JSON:

    ```bash
    python3 wordpress_site_health_monitoring.py --url="https://Domain or Website/" --username="WordPress Username" --application_password="Application Password"
    ```

## Configuration

1. Open the `wordpress_site_health_monitoring.cfg` file and provide your WordPress site configuration:

    ```ini
    [wordpress]
    url="https://localhost/wordpress/"
    username="wordpress_username"
    application_password="application_password"
    ```
2. For multiple server tracking, use the following configuration:

    ```ini
    [wordpress_site1]
    url="https://localhost/wordpress/"
    username="wordpress_username"
    application_password="application_password"

    [wordpress_site2]
    url="https://localhost/wordpress/"
    username="wordpress_username"
    application_password="application_password"
    ```

   **Notes:**
   - Ensure the WordPress username has administrator privileges or API access.
   - Use the application password generated in **Admin Login > Users > All Users > Application Passwords**. **Do not use the user's account password.**

3. Move the plugin under the Site24x7 agent directory

#### Linux
