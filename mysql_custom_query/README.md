# MySQL CUSTOM QUERY MONITORING

=================================================================

- This plugin is used to keep an eye on critical MySQL queries that impact the availability and performance of your business application. DBA, DevOps team can add the critical query for monitoring in their Database.. The monitor's dashboard is structured to give you an overview of the important metrics of the monitor.

  Using this plugin, the DBA, and DevOps teams can get information about the availability and the performance of the given database query.The plugin will execute the given query and display the result as performance data like column name as metric and assign the column value to the metric. However, for each data collection of the plugin, it will accept only the first row of the given MySQL table. Hence we recommend using the LIMIT clause in the query for better performance.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent/Site24x7 Windows agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.
- Install python with version>=3.7 
- To create a MySQL user:

		CREATE USER username@hostname IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
		
  Select on queries permission is required to execute the queries mentioned above.
  
		GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO username@hostname IDENTIFIED BY password;
		
  For Example, create a user called 'site24x7' with 'site24x7' as password. Give Select permission, SUPER or REPLICATION CLIENT privilege(s)  for the 'site24x7' user and  flush the privileges:
  
		CREATE USER site24x7@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'site24x7';
		GRANT SELECT ON mysql.* TO site24x7@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'site24x7';
		use mysql;
  		UPDATE mysql.user SET Super_Priv='Y' WHERE user='site24x7' AND host='localhost';  (or)
  		UPDATE mysql.user SET Repl_client_priv='Y' WHERE user='site24x7' AND host='localhost';
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  
  For MariaDB, use the following command:
  
		CREATE USER site24x7@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'site24x7';
		GRANT SUPER ON *.* TO 'site24x7'@'localhost';
		GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'site24x7'@'localhost'; 
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
