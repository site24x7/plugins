# clickhouse monitoring

### Prerequisites
- Download and install the latest version of the Site24x7 agent on the server where you plan to run the plugin.
- Python 3 must be installed.
- Install the **clickhouse-driver** module for Python:

```bash
pip install clickhouse-driver
```

### Create a Dedicated User for Monitoring

#### Steps to Create and Grant Permissions

Log in to ClickHouse as an admin or a user with sufficient privileges:

   ```bash
   clickhouse-client -u default --password
```
Run the following SQL query to create a new user and grant the required privileges:

```sql
-- Create a new user for monitoring
CREATE USER <username> IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';

-- Grant SELECT privileges on system tables (read-only access)
GRANT SELECT ON system.* TO <username>;
```

## Installation

- Create a directory named `clickhouse`:

```bash
mkdir clickhouse
cd clickhouse/
```
### Download Plugin Script

Download the plugin `clickhouse.py`, `clickhouse.cfg` and place it under the `clickhouse` directory:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/refs/heads/master/clickhouse/clickhouse.py
sed -i "1s|^.*|#! $(which python3)|" clickhouse.py

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/refs/heads/master/clickhouse/clickhouse.cfg
```
### Execute Plugin

Run the below command with appropriate arguments to check for valid JSON output:

```bash
python3 clickhouse.py --host "localhost" --port "9000" --username "default" --password "" --database "default"
```
### Move Plugin to Agent Directory

#### For Linux:

Place the `clickhouse` folder under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory:

```bash
mv clickhouse /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins
```
#### For Windows:

Since itâ€™s a Python plugin, follow the steps in [this link](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers) to run Python plugins on Windows. 

Move the `clickhouse` folder into the Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory:

```powershell
C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins
```
The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.
