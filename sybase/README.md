# Sybase Database Monitoring

## Quick installation

If you're using Linux servers, use the Sybase plugin installer that checks the prerequisites and installs the plugin with a bash script. You don't need to manually set up the plugin if you're using the installer.

Execute the command below in the terminal to run the installer and follow the instructions displayed on-screen:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/installer/Site24x7SybasePluginInstaller.sh && sudo bash Site24x7SybasePluginInstaller.sh
```
## Standard Installation
If you're not using Linux servers or want to install the plugin manually, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites
- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent](https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin.
- Run the following command in Sybase terminal to enable monitroing permission of databases
	```
	sp_configure "enable monitoring", 1
	```
	```
	sp_configure 'statement statistics active', 1
	```
	```
	EXEC sp_configure 'per object statistics active', 1
	```
	```
	EXEC sp_configure 'wait event timing', 1
	```
	```
	sp_configure 'statement statistics active', 1
	```

### Linux  

- Create a directory named "sybase".

- Download the below files in the "sybase" folder and place it under the "sybase" directory.

		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/sybase.sh
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/sybaseDB.java
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/json-20140107.jar
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/jconn4.jar

- Open sybase.sh file and set the values for HOST, USERNAME, PASSWORD, JAVA_HOME

- Run the command- which java. Copy the output you get and paste it in the JAVA_HOME field. Make sure to paste the path to bin directory and not the path to java.
- Run the following command to verify if the plugin is functioning correctly and returning valid JSON output:
```
bash sybase.sh
```
- Move the "sybase" folder to the site24x7 agent directory
```
  Linux             ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/sybase
```
- Once configured the agent will automatically execute the plugin in five minutes interval and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.

### Windows

- Create a directory "sybase" 

- Download the files "sybase.bat" , "sybaseDB.java", "json-20140107.jar", "jconn4.jar" and place it under the "sybase" directory:

		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/sybase.bat
		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/sybaseDB.java
		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/json-20140107.jar
		https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/sybase/jconn4.jar
    		
- Open sybase.bat file and set the values for HOST, USERNAME, PASSWORD, JAVA_HOME

- Run the command- where java. Copy the output of, bin directory of jdk and not the path to java.
- Run the following command to verify if the plugin is functioning correctly and returning valid JSON output:
```
.\sybase.bat
```
- Move the "sybase" into the Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory.
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\sybase
```
- Once configured the agent will automatically execute the plugin in five minutes interval and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.
