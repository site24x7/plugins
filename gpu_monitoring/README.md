# Plugin for Monitoring GPU Device

### Prerequisites

- Python version 3 or higher.

- Plugin Uses `gpustat` python module to get the gpu device performance metrics. Execute the following command in your server to install gpustat
	```
	pip install gpustat
	```

### Plugin Installation
---

  
#### Linux

- Create a directory named `gpu_monitoring`.

		mkdir gpu_monitoring
  		cd gpu_monitoring/

- Download the file [gpu_monitoring.py](https://github.com/site24x7/plugins/blob/master/gpu_monitoring/gpu_monitoring.py) and place it under the `gpu_monitoring` directory.
  
		wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/site24x7/plugins/master/gpu_monitoring/gpu_monitoring.py

- Execute the following command in your server to install gpustat.
	```
	pip install gpustat
	```

- Follow the steps in [this article](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/updating-python-path-in-a-plugin-script-for-linux-servers) to update the Python path in the gpu_monitoring.py script.

- Execute the below command in terminal to check for valid json output.

		python gpu_monitoring.py
  
- Move the directory `gpu_monitoring` under the Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory: 

		mv gpu_monitoring /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/


#### Windows
  
- Create a directory named `gpu_monitoring`.

- Download the file [gpu_monitoring.py](https://github.com/site24x7/plugins/blob/master/gpu_monitoring/gpu_monitoring.py) and place it under the `gpu_monitoring` directory

- Since it's a Python plugin, to run the plugin in a Windows server please follow the steps in [this link](https://support.site24x7.com/portal/en/kb/articles/run-python-plugin-scripts-in-windows-servers). The remaining configuration steps are the same.

- Execute the following command in your server to install gpustat.
	```
	pip install gpustat
	```
 
- Execute the below command in command prompt to check for valid json output.

		python gpu_monitoring.py

- Move the folder `gpu_monitoring` under Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory: 

		C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins
	
The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.
